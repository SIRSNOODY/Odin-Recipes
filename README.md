# Odin-Recipes
Recipes for the Odin Project Assignment

This assignment is to reinforce my current knowledge of HTML. 
So far I have built simple websites that contain the following:

Absolute links (To different websites)
Relative links (To webpages within my own site) 
Used practises to secure these links (Noopener / noreferrer)

Images

Lists

In this Assignment I will be making a recipe website which will contain an index page (Home page)
with links to a few different recipes. 

An Update:
I learnt quite abit, however less about HTML and more about Github and the process of Staging / Commiting / Pushing... 

I had accidentally pushed my main tree that included a parent repository. After some trial and error and deleting pretty much everything I then discovered the magic of GITHUB! 
A simple clone again from GH, delete the parent folder I didnt want in my commit and a repush has fixed this.
